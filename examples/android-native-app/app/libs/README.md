# AAR Files Directory

Place the MyRNFramework AAR file here after building:

```bash
# Build the AAR from MyRNFramework
cd MyRNFramework
npm run package:android

# Copy the AAR here
cp build/myrnframework.aar ../examples/android-native-app/app/libs/
```

The AAR file is not committed to git as it should be built locally.
